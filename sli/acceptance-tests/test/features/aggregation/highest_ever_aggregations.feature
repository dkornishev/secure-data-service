Feature: Aggregate highest ever assessments

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using the general data store
  And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone

Scenario: Post a zip file containing all configured interchanges as a payload of the ingestion job: Clean Database
Given I post "aggregationData/DataSet1.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  And the following collections are empty in datastore:
     | collectionName               |
     | assessment                   |
     | student                      |
     | studentSchoolAssociation     |
     | studentSectionAssociation     |
     | studentAssessmentAssociation |
When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job log has been created
Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
     | collectionName               | count |
     | student                      | 350   |
     | studentSchoolAssociation     | 350   |
     | studentSectionAssociation    | 350   |
     | studentAssessmentAssociation | 3500  |
When I run the highest ever aggregation job
   Then I check to find if record is in collection:
     | collectionName              | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter                                                         | searchValue |
     | student                     | 110                 | calculatedValues.assessments.2012ql-7bec8775-ceb0-11e1-8af5-0a0027000000.HighestEver.ScaleScore | 32.0        |
   And for the student with "body.studentUniqueStateId" set to "0", "calculatedValues.assessments.2012ql-7bec8775-ceb0-11e1-8af5-0a0027000000.HighestEver.ScaleScore" is "32.0"
   And for the student with "body.studentUniqueStateId" set to "1", "calculatedValues.assessments.2012ql-7bec8775-ceb0-11e1-8af5-0a0027000000.HighestEver.ScaleScore" is "27.0"
   And for the student with "body.studentUniqueStateId" set to "2", "calculatedValues.assessments.2012ql-7bec8775-ceb0-11e1-8af5-0a0027000000.HighestEver.ScaleScore" is "30.0"
When I run the proficiency aggregation job
   Then for the school with "body.educationOrgIdentificationCode.ID" set to "East Daybreak Junior High", "aggregates.assessments.2012ql-7bec8775-ceb0-11e1-8af5-0a0027000000.cut_points.E" is "296"
   Then for the school with "body.educationOrgIdentificationCode.ID" set to "East Daybreak Junior High", "aggregates.assessments.2012ql-7bec8775-ceb0-11e1-8af5-0a0027000000.cut_points.S" is "52"
   Then for the school with "body.educationOrgIdentificationCode.ID" set to "East Daybreak Junior High", "aggregates.assessments.2012ql-7bec8775-ceb0-11e1-8af5-0a0027000000.cut_points.B" is "2"
